---ABOUT---
During this time, our industry has come together with resources and webinars to allow ourselves to come back in full force.
This has been truly inspiring to see. I have been looking for something that I could contribute, that is when ETC released On Headset.
My goal with this was to first, play around with Augment3D, and then possibly provide this as a resource for the community to use.

This file is in no way perfect, for my first attempt to recreate a plot in Augment3D I learned a ton.
Hopefully this provides a good place for people to start, or at least to see what lights are turning on when they follow along.

---NOTES / DISCLAIMERS ---
- Conventional Focus is a bit wonky, not exactly sure what some purposes are so I made my best guesses.
- Some fixtures may be missing.
- Scenic and Theatre is modeled as best guess based on plot and photos - Also made simple for polygon count.
- I started a file from scratch for Augment3D, I then merged most of the original show file with mine. Patch and some palettes may be missing / incorrect.
- My computer actually started to die during creating this... of course I would want to make it better but I also wanted to get it out ASAP.

---THANK YOU---
Thank you to Ken Billington and his team for sharing these resources.
Thank you ETC for your continued support to your community and for creating this.

Thank you to the community.
